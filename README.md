Hello world! I'm Chris, a developer who loves creating outstanding projects. Whether I'm working on the front-end or the back-end, for a client or a passion project, every commit counts!

## Data engineer
I trained as a Data Engineer during the longest (and among the best) 13 weeks of my life at Northcoders in 2023.

Want to process transactions faster? Want to optimise your database for analysis? Just give me a reason, as there's little in this world that gives me greater satisfaction than watching little parcels of data move from one place to another.

## Web developer
My background in design goes back to winning a poster competition when I was 11! While I have always found desiging for print to be limiting, I love seeing projects come to life on the web!

My specialty is creating beautiful and accessible forms â€“ I can't escape the data engineer in me! I know that I've filled out enough rage-inducing forms on the web that I know I don't want to write any more of them, which means I craft them carefully and with a user-focussed approach.
