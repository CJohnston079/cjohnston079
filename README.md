## Web developer
My background in design goes back to winning a poster competition when I was 11! When I began to run up against the limitations of print-media design, I moved to the web, first using 3rd party tools like Squarespace, and then by coding my own designs from scratch.

It wasn't long before I wanted to make my designs interactive, which is when I dove into JavaScript, and continued down the rabbit hole until I was making full-on REST APIs in Express.

My specialty is creating beautiful and accessible forms. I know that I've filled out enough rage-inducing forms on the web that I know I don't want to write any more of them, which means I craft them carefully and with a user-focussed approach.

## Data engineer
I trained as a Data Engineer during the longest (and among the best) 13 weeks of my life at Northcoders in 2023, and completing my journey from the front end to the back end. 

Want to process transactions faster? Want to optimise your database for analysis? Just give me a reason, as there's little in this world that gives me greater satisfaction than watching little parcels of data move from one place to another.
